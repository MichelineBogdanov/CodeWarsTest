/*
* Write a function that accepts a string consisting only of ASCII letters and space(s) and
* returns that string in block letters of 5 characters width and 7 characters height, with one space between characters.
* The block letters should consist of corresponding capital letters.
* It's irrelevant whether input consists of lower or upper case letters.
* Any leading and/or trailing spaces in input should be ignored.
* Empty strings or such containing only spaces should return an empty string.
* The remaining spaces (between letters and/or words) are to be treated as any other character.
* This means that there will be six spaces in output for a space in input, or a multiple of six,
* if there were more spaces - plus the one from preceding character!
* Trailing spaces should be removed in the resulting string.
* The string should be formatted in a way that when passed to Javas' System.out.println()
* function shows the desired output (see below for example).
* System.out.println(BlockLetterPrinter.blockPrint("heLLo WorLD"));
* should result in an output that looks like this:
*   H   H EEEEE L     L      OOO                W   W  OOO  RRRR  L     DDDD
*   H   H E     L     L     O   O               W   W O   O R   R L     D   D
*   H   H E     L     L     O   O               W   W O   O R   R L     D   D
*   HHHHH EEEEE L     L     O   O               W W W O   O RRRR  L     D   D
*   H   H E     L     L     O   O               W W W O   O R R   L     D   D
*   H   H E     L     L     O   O               W W W O   O R  R  L     D   D
*   H   H EEEEE LLLLL LLLLL  OOO                 W W   OOO  R   R LLLLL DDDD
